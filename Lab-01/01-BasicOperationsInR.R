# Variable – used for storing data and results of the operations. Value of the variable
# can be a number, sequence of characters or other data structure. Variable must have
# a name, which will be used for calling its content in the code. Name is set freely by
# the user, but needs to comply with these conditions:

# • Must start with a letter or an underscore _ symbol
# • May contain only letters, numbers and underscore
# • In names there is a difference between upper and lower-case
# • You can use local letters in the names

a1 <- 12
a2 = 10
a3 <- a1+a2

# Function – sequence of instructions, making up for a block of code, which can be
# used multiple times in different places. Functions usually return certain values after
# finishing their wor
# function(argument1, argument2, argument3, ...)
# a <- function(argument1, argument2, argument3, ...
