	abstract = {We present a state-of-the-art speech recognition system developed using end-to-end deep learning. Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a "phoneme." Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0\% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.},

	abstract = {We present Deep Voice, a production-quality text-to-speech system constructed entirely from deep neural networks. Deep Voice lays the groundwork for truly end-to-end neural speech synthesis. The system comprises five major building blocks: a segmentation model for locating phoneme boundaries, a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion model, a phoneme duration prediction model, a fundamental frequency prediction model, and an audio synthesis model. For the segmentation model, we propose a novel way of performing phoneme boundary detection with deep neural networks using connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss. For the audio synthesis model, we implement a variant of WaveNet that requires fewer parameters and trains faster than the original. By using a neural network for each component, our system is simpler and more flexible than traditional text-to-speech systems, where each component requires laborious feature engineering and extensive domain expertise. Finally, we show that inference with our system can be performed faster than real time and describe optimized WaveNet inference kernels on both CPU and GPU that achieve up to 400x speedups over existing implementations.},

By altering these predictions, the generated speech can be more expressive, better match the semantic of the utterance, and in the end more engaging to the listener. Uniformly increasing or decreasing pitch with FastPitch generates speech that resembles the voluntary modulation of voice. Conditioning on frequency contours improves the overall quality of synthesized speech, making it comparable to state-of-the-art. It does not introduce an overhead, and FastPitch retains the favorable, fully-parallel Transformer architecture, with over 900× real-time factor for mel-spectrogram synthesis of a typical utterance.},

The system is composed of a recurrent sequence-to-sequence feature prediction network that maps character embeddings to mel-scale spectrograms, followed by a modified WaveNet model acting as a vocoder to synthesize time-domain waveforms from those spectrograms. Our model achieves a mean opinion score (MOS) of 4.53 comparable to a MOS of 4.58 for professionally recorded speech. To validate our design choices, we present ablation studies of key components of our system and evaluate the impact of using mel spectrograms as the conditioning input to WaveNet instead of linguistic, duration, and F0 features. We further show that using this compact acoustic intermediate representation allows for a significant reduction in the size of the WaveNet architecture.},

Additionally, we show that a reference prosody embedding can be used to synthesize text that is different from that of the reference utterance. We define several quantitative and subjective metrics for evaluating prosody transfer, and report results with accompanying audio samples from single-speaker and 44-speaker Tacotron models on a prosody transfer task.},

The model is fully probabilistic and autoregressive, with the predictive distribution for each audio sample conditioned on all previous ones; nonetheless we show that it can be efficiently trained on data with tens of thousands of samples per second of audio. When applied to text-to-speech, it yields state-of-the-art performance, with human listeners rating it as significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative systems for both English and Mandarin. A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity. When trained to model music, we find that it generates novel and often highly realistic musical fragments. We also show that it can be employed as a discriminative model, returning promising results for phoneme recognition.},

	abstract = {We introduce a novel Big Data analytics model to detect upward revenue misreporting. The model uses freely available Google searches of firm products to provide external entity business state (EBS) evidence. The veracity of the reported numbers is enhanced when auditors can obtain external EBS evidence congruent with the reported numbers. The Google search volume index (SVI) of firm products is a good candidate for such EBS evidence because it nowcasts (i.e. predicts present) firm sales and is independent of management control. A large discrepancy such as a high sales growth together with a large decline in the SVI suggests possible manipulation upwards of revenues. We find that an indicator variable, MUP, of a firm in the top sales growth quartile and bottom ΔSVI quartile in each industry-quarter predicts revenue misstatements incrementally to the F\_Score, Discretionary-Revenues model, two alternative upward revenue manipulation identifiers, and analyst and media coverages. MUP predictability is stronger in end-user industries and in interim quarters relative to the fourth quarter. We also find corroborating evidence that MUP firms have lower sales growth persistence, larger increases in accounts receivables, and lower allowances for bad debts, consistent with their lower revenue quality.},

Vehicle plates that have been detected and recognized were inputted into Google Lens to capture the resulting text from the ESP32CAM camera recording. The results of this study were that for 70 seconds, ten plate samples were obtained, which were 100\% perfect in reading license plates on Google Lens, namely six plates and two plates read 90\%, one plate read 60\%, and one plate read 0\%. The research conclusions obtained were ten samples, six samples with perfect readings, and one error sample because of the white plate color.

Testing is done in order to ensure that software complies with user requirements as defined in the specification of the software requirement specification (SRS). Testing can be automated or manual. Many web based applications are already working for a few days using internet browsers. Using the Selenium web driver will reduce the time expended on testing. Selenium is a web based online testing tool. Testers do not have to learn the selenium web driver tool thoroughly in order to test the sample. Selenium testing is a useful technique for developers and testers to test their code. Selenium supports many popular programming languages such as C\#, Java, Python, etc. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the use of the Python Selenium tool for automated testing of web applications.},

While automated testing methods appear to take over the role of the human testers, the issues of reliability and the capability of the testing method still need to be solved. In our paper, we focus on the automation of functional tests of websites. A single web page may contain a huge set of important functionalities leading to the execution of critical web service operations. Besides, testing all of these functionalities implemented in a web page service is highly complex. Two current popular research areas for automation web-based testing are Codeless Functional Test Automation and Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI) in test automation. We therefore define and implement a framework to figure out how to automate the web service product under test, the machine can detect or predict the change and adapt those changes to suitable generic test cases.

Simultaneously retrieving multiple objects in a test image adds to the difficulty of the problem, especially if the objects are visually similar. This paper presents an efficient approach for per-exemplar multi-label image classification, which targets the recognition and localization of products in retail store images. We achieve runtime efficiency through the use of discriminative random forests, deformable dense pixel matching and genetic algorithm optimization. Cross-dataset recognition is performed, where our training images are taken in ideal conditions with only one single training image per product label, while the evaluation set is taken using a mobile phone in real-life scenarios in completely different conditions. In addition, we provide a large novel dataset and labeling tools for products image search, to motivate further research efforts on multi-label retail products image classification. The proposed approach achieves promising results in terms of both accuracy and runtime efficiency on 680 annotated images of our dataset, and 885 test images of GroZi-120 dataset. We make our dataset of 8350 different product images and the 680 test images from retail stores with complete annotations available to the wider community.},

	abstract = {Visually assisted product image search has gained increasing popularity because of its capability to greatly improve end users' e-commerce shopping experiences. Different from general-purpose content-based image retrieval (CBIR) applications, the specific goal of product image search is to retrieve and rank relevant products from a large-scale product database to visually assist a user's online shopping experience. In this paper, we explore the problem of product image search through salient edge characterization and analysis, for which we propose a novel image search method coupled with an interactive user region-of-interest indication function. Given a product image, the proposed approach first extracts an edge map, based on which contour curves are further extracted. We then segment the extracted contours into fragments according to the detected contour corners. After that, a set of salient edge elements is extracted from each product image. Based on salient edge elements matching and similarity evaluation, the method derives a new pairwise image similarity estimate. Using the new image similarity, we can then retrieve product images. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we conducted 120 sessions of querying experiments on a data set comprised of around 13k product images collected from multiple, real-world e-commerce websites. We compared the performance of the proposed method with that of a bag-of-words method (Philbin, Chum, Isard, Sivic, \& Zisserman, 2008) and a Pyramid Histogram of Orientated Gradients (PHOG) method (Bosch, Zisserman, \& Munoz, 2007). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance of example-based product image retrieval.},

	abstract = {Chatbots are one class of intelligent, conversational software agents activated by natural language input (which can be in the form of text, voice, or both). They provide conversational output in response, and if commanded, can sometimes also execute tasks. Although chatbot technologies have existed since the 1960s and have influenced user interface development in games since the early 1980s, chatbots are now easier to train and implement. This is due to plentiful open source code, widely available development platforms, and implementation options via Software as a Service (SaaS). In addition to enhancing customer experiences and supporting learning, chatbots can also be used to engineer social harm - that is, to spread rumors and misinformation, or attack people for posting their thoughts and opinions online. This paper presents a literature review of quality issues and attributes as they relate to the contemporary issue of chatbot development and implementation. Finally, quality assessment approaches are reviewed, and a quality assessment method based on these attributes and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is proposed and examined.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the rapid development of the Internet has promoted the continuous expansion of the scale of China’s tourism industry, and the amount of tourism data has surged. However, tourists need help bringing personal interest and high-value data from the plethora of tourism information. The rise of artificial intelligence has transformed traditional tourism into an intelligent, data-driven industry. This shift has generated vast tourism data, offering both opportunities and challenges. The paper discusses an AI and IoT-based Intelligent Tourism Recommendation System (ITRS) that offers travelers predefined itineraries, personalized suggestions, and tourism insights. This system simplifies attraction discovery, unveiling hidden value within tourism data at the intersection of AI and IoT. The present study thoroughly investigates AI-based recommendation algorithms before delving into the system’s architecture. It categorizes user-based, project-based, and article-based collaborative filtering methodologies tailored to specific goals. First, thoroughly examine AI-based recommendation algorithms before delving into the system architecture. Second, categorize collaborative filtering methods as user-based, project-based, and article-based, each tailored to specific objectives. Third, delve into the Apriori algorithm’s complexity within the context of weighted association rules and introduce an enhanced iteration for improved efficiency. The proposed scheme encompasses an elaborate ITRS plan featuring a user interest model and a client module, crucial for the computation and analysis of users’ long-term and short-term interests. Rigorous performance testing confirms the ITRS’s superiority across varying support levels, with experimental results demonstrating the Apriori algorithm’s exceptional accuracy, achieving a 94.3\% improvement over other methods. The Apriori algorithm is better than traditional recommendation algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, K-nearest neighbor, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost.},

	abstract = {Tour planning has become both challenging and time-consuming due to the huge amount of information available online and the variety of options to choose from. This is more so as each traveler has unique set of interests and location preferences in addition to other tour-based constraints such as vaccination status and pandemic travel restrictions. Several travel planning companies and agencies have emerged with more sophisticated online services to capitalize on global tourism effectively by using technology for making suitable recommendations to travel seekers. However, such systems predominantly adopt a destination-based recommendation approach and often come as bundled packages with limited customization options for incorporating each traveler’s preferences. To address these limitations, “thematic travel planning” has emerged as a recent alternative with researchers adopting text-based data mining for achieving value-added online tourism services. Understanding the need for a more holistic theme approach in this domain, our aim is to propose an augmented model to integrate analytics of a variety of big data (both static and dynamic). Our unique inclusive model covers text mining and data mining of destination images, reviews on tourist activities, weather forecasts, and recent events via social media for generating more user-centric and location-based thematic recommendations efficiently. In this paper, we describe an implementation of our proposed inclusive hybrid recommendation model that uses data of multimodal ranking of user preferences. Furthermore, in this study, we present an experimental evaluation of our model’s effectiveness. We present the details of our improvised model that employs various statistical and machine learning techniques on existing data available online, such as travel forums and social media reviews in order to arrive at the most relevant and suitable travel recommendations. Our hybrid recommender built using various Spark models such as naïve Bayes classifier, trigonometric functions, deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN), time series, and NLP with sentiment scores using AFINN (sentiment analysis developed by Finn Årup Nielsen) shows promising results in the directions of benefit for an individual model’s complementary advantages. Overall, our proposed hybrid recommendation algorithm serves as an active learner of user preferences and ranking by collecting explicit information via the system and uses such rich information to make personalized augmented recommendations according to the unique preferences of travelers.},

	abstract = {Providing personalized recommendation service for users and improving the accuracy of recommendation and user satisfaction are the main research tasks of current travel recommendation systems. The intelligent recommendation model of tourist places requires the algorithm to be able to accurately recommend tourist attractions according to the user’s interests. Big data and artificial intelligence technologies have driven the development of intelligent recommendation systems. However, realistic data are often sparse, and the lack of common rating items among users makes some traditional similarity measures impossible to calculate. In addition, traditional collaborative filtering algorithms ignore the issue of user preferences, which can cause a decrease in recommendation accuracy. To address these issues, this paper analyzes the factors affecting users’ interest preferences in terms of their global and local rating information. The interest preferences of users are calculated by computing the probability distribution of user rating information globally and using Hamming approach degree. A similarity algorithm about user preferences is derived using Jeffries-Matusita distance. The similarity algorithm is effectively combined with the traditional similarity algorithm to propose a model of collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm for tourist attractions based on user preferences under sparse data. The paper aims to improve the accuracy of tourist attraction recommendation systems by incorporating user preferences and addressing the issue of sparse data and the lack of common rating items among users that traditional similarity measures cannot calculate. The experimental results show that the improved algorithm model outperforms the traditional collaborative filtering algorithm and other algorithms. And it also has high accuracy rate on more sparse tourism data set.},

	abstract = {The soil is the primary source of selenium intake for humans and animals. Investigating selenium's migration from soil to crops and the human body holds significant scientific value in assessing agroecosystems and human well-being. This study analyzes selenium levels in soils, crops, and human hair in Aksu, Xinjiang, a selenium-rich farmland, focusing on the Selenium-Crop-Hair System (SCHS). In Aksu's selenium-rich farmland, soil selenium ranged from 0.09 to 4.60 mg/kg, averaging 0.356 mg/kg. Among crops, average selenium content ranked as follows: wheat (0.084 mg/kg) {\textgreater} rice (0.079 mg/kg) {\textgreater} maize (0.065 mg/kg) {\textgreater} carrot (0.058 mg/kg) {\textgreater} walnut (0.044 mg/kg) {\textgreater} apple (0.042 mg/kg) {\textgreater} jujubes (0.039 mg/kg). Human hair displayed selenium content ranging from 0.34 to 0.57 mg/kg, averaging 0.46 mg/kg. Overall, selenium levels in soils, crops, and human hair fall within selenium-moderate to selenium-sufficient ranges. Comparatively, bioaccumulation factors (BAF) of rice/soil (0.22) and hair/soil (1.28) in Aksu surpass those in other Chinese regions, indicating higher selenium bioavailability in the northwestern, China. Rice and carrots, under intense irrigation, exhibited a strong correlation in selenium content among crops, rhizosphere soil, and background soil. Conversely, weak correlations were observed between the edible part of apples, walnuts, jujubes, wheat, maize, rhizosphere soil, and background soil. Intensively irrigated farmland showed higher selenium content in rhizosphere soil and crops compared to rainfed fields, suggesting that irrigation, potentially coupled with intercropping and residue management, may enhance selenium migration and circulation in soils. However, crop selenium content may be more influenced by biological absorption characteristics.},

However, most of the discussions occur in higher education. In schools, teachers’ perspectives are crucial for making sense of innovative technologies. Accordingly, this qualitative study aims to investigate how GenAI changes our school education from the perspectives of teachers and leaders. It used four domains – learning, teaching, assessment, and administration – as the initial framework suggested in a systematic literature review study on AI in education. The participants were 88 school teachers and leaders of different backgrounds. They completed a survey and joined a focus group to share how ChatGPT and Midjounery had a GenAI effect on school education. Thematic analysis identified four main themes and 12 subthemes. The findings provide three suggestions for practices: know-it-all attitude, new prerequisite knowledge, interdisciplinary teaching, and three implications for policy: new assessment, AI education, and professional standards. They also further suggest six future research directions for GenAI in education.},

	abstract = {Automatic program synthesis is a long-lasting dream in software engineering. Recently, a promising Deep Learning (DL) based solution, called Copilot, has been proposed by OpenAI and Microsoft as an industrial product. Although some studies evaluate the correctness of Copilot solutions and report its issues, more empirical evaluations are necessary to understand how developers can benefit from it effectively. In this paper, we study the capabilities of Copilot in two different programming tasks: (i) generating (and reproducing) correct and efficient solutions for fundamental algorithmic problems, and (ii) comparing Copilot’s proposed solutions with those of human programmers on a set of programming tasks. For the former, we assess the performance and functionality of Copilot in solving selected fundamental problems in computer science, like sorting and implementing data structures. In the latter, a dataset of programming problems with human-provided solutions is used. The results show that Copilot is capable of providing solutions for almost all fundamental algorithmic problems, however, some solutions are buggy and non-reproducible. Moreover, Copilot has some difficulties in combining multiple methods to generate a solution. Comparing Copilot to humans, our results show that the correct ratio of humans’ solutions is greater than Copilot’s suggestions, while the buggy solutions generated by Copilot require less effort to be repaired. Based on our findings, if Copilot is used by expert developers in software projects, it can become an asset since its suggestions could be comparable to humans’ contributions in terms of quality. However, Copilot can become a liability if it is used by novice developers who may fail to filter its buggy or non-optimal solutions due to a lack of expertise.},

	abstract = {With the ever-increasing development of technology and its integration into users’ private and professional life, a decision regarding its acceptance or rejection still remains an open question. A respectable amount of work dealing with the technology acceptance model (TAM), from its first appearance more than a quarter of a century ago, clearly indicates a popularity of the model in the field of technology acceptance. Originated in the psychological theory of reasoned action and theory of planned behavior, TAM has evolved to become a key model in understanding predictors of human behavior toward potential acceptance or rejection of the technology. The main aim of the paper is to provide an up-to-date, well-researched resource of past and current references to TAM-related literature and to identify possible directions for future TAM research. The paper presents a comprehensive concept-centric literature review of the TAM, from 1986 onwards. According to a designed methodology, 85 scientific publications have been selected and classified according to their aim and content into three categories such as (i) TAM literature reviews, (ii) development and extension of TAM, and (iii) modification and application of TAM. Despite a continuous progress in revealing new factors with significant influence on TAM’s core variables, there are still many unexplored areas of model potential application that could contribute to its predictive validity. Consequently, four possible future directions for TAM research based on the conducted literature review and analysis are identified and presented.},

	abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence will have a major impact on the ways of working. The groundbreaking technology has emerged for creating diverse content, generating text, images, and audio. These models, pre-trained on vast datasets and fine-tuned iteratively, demonstrate an exceptional capacity to generate human-like, high-quality outputs. Notable Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Bard, GitHub Copilot, Microsoft Bing, and Microsoft Copilot have become invaluable assistants in a wide array of tasks. These technologies are developing fast and provoke a discussion of the future of work. Knowledge work, encompassing the efforts of experts, researchers, specialists, and managers, is characterized by its autonomous, complex, and often ambiguous nature. Generative AI tools hold the promise of enhancing knowledge work by increasing productivity and reducing the time spent on repetitive tasks. These tools enable the creation of content such as emails, articles, summaries, code writing and debugging, and information retrieval, while also boosting creativity and learning rates. Nevertheless, Generative AI has its limitations, including potential biases and inaccuracies, which prevent it from replacing knowledge work requiring critical thinking and deep expertise. This study investigates the acceptance of Generative AI among knowledge workers in Finland, aiming to identify the factors influencing its adoption. Employing a modified UTAUT model, the research was conducted as a survey and using quantitative methods. The respondents included students and professionals from fields like software development, consultancy, and management. Seven factors emerged as determinants of Generative AI acceptance: Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Peer Social Influence, Superior Social Influence, Attitude, Trust, and Behavioral Intention to Use. The conceptual model was tested using structural equation modelling. The results indicate that Attitude exerts the most substantial influence on the intention to use Generative AI, followed by Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, and Peer Social Influence. Trust, Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, and Peer Social Influence significantly impact Attitude. On contrary to Peer Social Influence the Superior Influence was found to be significant. In general, respondents expressed positive attitudes towards Generative AI, finding it enjoyable and useful for enhancing productivity and task completion. The research highlights the importance of incorporating Attitude into the UTAUT model and contributes to developing the model to explain the factors impacting utilization and acceptance of technology.},

	abstract = {The current study aims to establish a connection between students' behavioral concerns, namely stress and anxiety, related to the completion of academic tasks, and their integration of technology using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) through the utilization of Chat-GPT via ubiquitous learning (UL) procedure. To achieve this objective, data was collected from 156 students studying management science who were engaged in their final year research projects or internship reports from selected universities in Pakistan. The gathered data underwent analysis through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using Smart PLS software. The findings reveal a significant relationship: students' stress contributes to the emergence of anxiety, which in turn motivates the adoption of technology-assisted solutions, specifically Chat-GPT, to efficiently complete assigned tasks within deadlines working through any device from anywhere. Consequently, the perceived ease of use and usefulness associated with Chat-GPT's AI-generated text contribute to shaping students' favorable attitudes toward utilizing Chat-GPT and also play a role in reducing their stress levels. Furthermore, the study confirms that the development of a positive attitude in students acts as a driving force, compelling them to engage with Chat-GPT through ubiquitous learning (UL) procedure, ultimately resulting in increased actual usage of Chat-GPT. This pattern, in turn, contributes to stress and anxiety reduction among management science students. The study's outcomes corroborate the TAM model, which aligns with the social exchange process, demonstrating its applicability within the context of the educational setup in management sciences and its potential to enhance the learning experiences of researchers.},

	abstract = {With the diversification of generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications, the interest in their use in every segment and field of society in recent years has been increasing rapidly. One of these areas is programming learning and program writing processes. One of the generative AI tools used for this purpose is ChatGPT. The use of ChatGPT in program writing processes has become widespread, and this tool has a certain potential in the programming process. However, when the literature is examined, research results related to using ChatGPT for this purpose have yet to be found. The existing literature has a gap that requires exploration. This study aims to analyze the students' perspectives on using ChatGPT in the field of programming and programming learning. The study encompassed a cohort of 41 undergraduate students enrolled in a public university's Computer Technology and Information Systems department. The research was carried out within the scope of the Object-Oriented Programming II course for eight weeks. Throughout the research process, students were given project assignments related to the course every week, and they were asked to use ChatGPT while solving them. The research data was collected using a form consisting of open-ended questions and analyzed through content analysis. The research findings revealed both the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT usage, as perceived by the students. The students stated that the main benefits of using ChatGPT in programming learning are providing fast and mostly correct answers to questions, improving thinking skills, facilitating debugging, and increasing self-confidence. On the other hand, the main limitations of using ChatGPT in programming education were getting students used to laziness, being unable to answer some questions, or giving incomplete/incorrect answers, causing professional anxiety in students. Based on the results of the research, it can be said that it would be useful to integrate generative AI tools into programming courses considering the advantages they provide in programming teaching. However, appropriate measures should be taken regarding the limitations it brings. Based on the research findings, several recommendations were proposed regarding the integration of ChatGPT into lessons.},

However, only a few studies have tested the effect of the accuracy of AI-based quality detection on users' acceptance and use of these applications. This study aims to fill this gap by addressing the impact of perceived accuracy on behavioral intention and behavior using the AIKU application. This research uses a quantitative approach with the online survey method, distributed in January 2023 - February 2023 to AIKU users. Valid data were 287 respondents from 317 who were received and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). This study uses a modified technology acceptance (TAM) model by adding perceived intelligence as a mediating variable between perceived accuracy and usefulness. The results showed that nine hypotheses were accepted from the 13 hypotheses proposed. The results section of hypothesis testing shows that the effect of perceived AIKU application accuracy on perceived usability and ease of use is insignificant. However, these influences indirectly affect the behavioral intentions and attitudes of users. Even if users do not perceive purity as an essential factor, the user's attitude towards the application is still positive. This study makes a theoretical contribution by developing the TAM model by incorporating variables of perceived accuracy and perceived intelligence relevant to the AI-based context.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has been proven to be a disruptive financial technology in the context of mobile banking that can provide more practical value to users and banks. AI is a critical way of facilitating user acceptance and adoption of mobile banking applications (apps). Nevertheless, the ways in which AI features influence users’ continuance intention towards AI-enabled mobile banking apps have not been investigated from the perspective of an expectation confirmation model (ECM). To address this research gap, this paper develops a research model by combining two constructs pertaining to AI characteristics, namely, perceived intelligence and perceived anthropomorphism, and by using the ECM to explore users’ continuance intentions in this context. We employed a survey research method using a random sampling approach to collect 365 valid responses. A partial least squares approach was used to examine the model. The results show that both intelligence and anthropomorphism can increase user satisfaction via confirmation and perceived usefulness, which in turn fosters users’ willingness to continue to engage in mobile banking. This paper offers theoretical advancements, discusses future directions for mobile banking research and provides practical guidance to app developers with respect to designing and developing proper mobile banking apps using AI technology.},

	abstract = {As the autonomous vehicles technology gradually enters the public eye, understanding consumers' psychological motivations for accepting autonomous vehicles is critical for the development of autonomous vehicles and society. Previously, researchers have explored the determinants of fully autonomous vehicles but the relevant research is far from enough. Moreover, the relationship between anthropomorphism and users' behavior has been ignored to a large extent. Therefore, this study aim to fill the gap by using anthropomorphism and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to explore how system attributes (i.e., perceived anthropomorphism, perceived intelligence) and UTAUT attributes influence consumers' acceptance behavior. The data were collected via questionnaire survey conducted in Beijing, China, which can be a promising early adopter of AVs. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The results reveal that perceived anthropomorphism and perceived intelligence have a direct positive influence on the adoption of AVs; performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions have an indirect positive influence on intention to adopt AVs. Also, this research contributes to the literature by enriching studies on psychological determinants of autonomous vehicles' adoption by taking an initial step to highlight anthropomorphism perceptions. This can provide managerial implications for policy-makers and businesses on how to effectively allocate resources to enhance autonomous vehicle adoption. Copyright © 2022 Tian and Wang.},

The use of AI augmentation has the potential to enhance design performance, however, there is limited research on the acceptance of AI-augmented design. The research gap under consideration in this study is addressed by presenting an acceptance model designed for AI-augmented design. This model integrates a range of variables including perceived privacy risk, enjoyment, perceived value, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived behavioral control, social influence, and behavioral intention. The proposed model was validated through a questionnaire survey of 249 designers in China. The results reveal that enjoyment, perceived value, perceived ease of use, perceived behavioral control, and social influence have a significant positive impact on users' intention to use AI-augmented design, while perceived privacy risk has a significant negative impact. Perceived value was found to mediate the relationship between enjoyment and behavioral intention, while perceived behavioral control play a mediation role in the relationship between social influence and behavioral intention. In conclusion, this study highlights the variables that influence the acceptance of AI-augmented design and provides valuable insights into the potential benefits and drawbacks of integrating AI technologies in design. The proposed acceptance model serves as a framework for future research in this area and can guide the development of more user-friendly and effective AI-augmented design tools and technologies.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are predicted to infiltrate most industries within the next decade, creating a personal, industrial, and social shift towards the new technology. As a result, there has been a surge of interest and research towards user acceptance of AI technology in recent years. However, the existing research appears dispersed and lacks systematic synthesis, limiting our understanding of user acceptance of AI technologies. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-Analysis guidelines using five databases: EBSCO host, Embase, Inspec (Engineering Village host), Scopus, and Web of Science. Papers were required to focus on both user acceptance and AI technology. Acceptance was defined as the behavioural intention or willingness to use, buy, or try a good or service. A total of 7912 articles were identified in the database search. Sixty articles were included in the review. Most studies (n = 31) did not define AI in their papers, and 38 studies did not define AI for their participants. The extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was the most frequently used theory to assess user acceptance of AI technologies. Perceived usefulness, performance expectancy, attitudes, trust, and effort expectancy significantly and positively predicted behavioural intention, willingness, and use behaviour of AI across multiple industries. However, in some cultural scenarios, it appears that the need for human contact cannot be replicated or replaced by AI, no matter the perceived usefulness or perceived ease of use. Given that most of the methodological approaches present in the literature have relied on self-reported data, further research using naturalistic methods is needed to validate the theoretical model/s that best predict the adoption of AI technologies.},

	abstract = {As AI-enhanced technologies become common in a variety of domains, there is an increasing need to define and examine the trust that users have in such technologies. Given the progress in the development of AI, a correspondingly sophisticated understanding of trust in the technology is required. This paper addresses this need by explaining the role of trust in the intention to use AI technologies. Study 1 examined the role of trust in the use of AI voice assistants based on survey responses from college students. A path analysis confirmed that trust had a significant effect the on intention to use AI, which operated through perceived usefulness and participants’ attitude toward voice assistants. In Study 2, using data from a representative sample of the U.S. population, different dimensions of trust were examined using exploratory factor analysis, which yielded two dimensions: human-like trust and functionality trust. The results of the path analyses from Study 1 were replicated in Study 2, confirming the indirect effect of trust and the effects of perceived usefulness, ease of use, and attitude on intention to use. Further, both dimensions of trust shared a similar pattern of effects within the model, with functionality-related trust exhibiting a greater total impact on usage intention than human-like trust. Overall, the role of trust in the acceptance of AI technologies was significant across both studies. This research contributes to the advancement and application of the TAM in AI-related applications and offers a multidimensional measure of trust that can be utilized in the future study of trustworthy AI.},

Determining the significance of a particular tool and predicting the success of implantation is essential prior to its adoption. This paper presents and modifies the technology acceptance model (TAM) in an attempt to assist public universities, particularly in Saudi Arabia, in predicting the behavioural intention to use learning management systems (LMS). This study proposed a theoretical framework that includes the core constructs in TAM: namely, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and attitude toward usage. Additional external variables were also adopted—namely, the lack of LMS availability, prior experience (LMS usage experience), and job relevance. The overall research model suggests that all mentioned variables either directly or indirectly affect the overall behavioural intention to use an LMS. Initial findings suggest the applicability of using TAM to measure the behavioural intention to use an LMS. Further, the results confirm the original TAM’s findings.},

It can be used as a preventive healthcare tool also. Despite the potential, minimal studies exist on the technology adoption of mHealth. There have been inadequate studies in the context of India. To find out the domains where studies can be conducted and after a thorough literature review, the study employed the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for the smooth running of mobile health services. As a theoretical contribution, this research is an extended version of the TAM, suggested by Davis, through considering six additional variables such as social influence, technology anxiety, trust, perceived risk, perceived physical condition, Resistance to change. To validate the linkages, a close-ended questionnaire was developed after a thorough literature survey. The current study collected 289 valid responses from different mHealth services users. The constructs of the model have been tested in Indian settings by conducting exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Further, Structural equation modelling is ably employed to validate the model to suit the Indian requirements. The adoption of mHealth was found to have had an enormous impact on social influence, behavioural intention and trust. The empirical examination showed high predictive power for adoption intention of mHealth services and the influential role of these important constructs. The implications for academics and policymakers have been discussed in this study. Finally, the future scope and limitations of the study have been discussed.},

This paper synthesized the technology acceptance model (TAM), to explain and predict the users’ intentions
to continue using e-payment system. The hypothesized model was validated empirically using a sample data
collected from a modified e-payment questionnaire. A simple random sample technique was used to select 250
academic and non academic staff at the University of Ilorin, Nigeria. The results reveal correlation among
perceived usefulness and attitude to use, perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, perceived ease of
use and attitude; perceived enjoyment and continuance intention to use, speed and actual use. Furthermore,
attitude, satisfaction and actual use were all associated with continuance intention. Moreover, all the nine
e-payment predictive factors together made 65\% of e-payment continuance intention, and similarly; perceived
usefulness, perceived ease of use, enjoyment, speed; perceived benefits, user satisfaction, actual use and attitude
are good predictors of e-payment continuance intention.},

	abstract = {Introduction. In information systems literature, the Technology Acceptance Model is one of the most widely used approaches for modelling adoption behaviour, including e-commerce applications. In this paper, we propose to extend this model by adding a relationship between technology acceptance and the perceived presence of a community and its characteristics. Method. We employ an empirical study based on a questionnaire distributed after using a Web-based system. We use three groups, including one control group where community features are disabled using technology, but keeping the same environment and situation otherwise. Analysis. We first employ a factor analysis, then correlation analysis and structural equation modelling. In addition, we do statistical tests comparing the three groups. Results. The proposed model is partially supported by the empirical results in which we find that there is a link from community characteristics to perceived usefulness as well as to purchasing intention. Conclusions. Acceptance and adoption behaviour of users is not only shaped by the perceived usefulness and ease of use, but also by perceived community characteristics. It turns out that the perceived community size alone does not account for a major impact, but perceived community structure, including the presence of users showing lead-user characteristics, has an important role.},

Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitions for these two variables were used to develop scale items that were pretested for content validity and then tested for reliability and construct validity in two studies involving a total of 152 users and four application programs. The measures were refined and streamlined, resulting in two six-item scales with reliabilities of .98 for usefulness and .94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminant, and factorial validity. Perceived usefulness was significantly correlated with both self-reported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predicted future usage (r =.85, Study 2). Perceived ease of use was also significantly correlated with current usage (r=.45, Study 1) and future usage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantly greater correlation with usage behavior than did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel, direct determinant of system usage. Implications are drawn for future research on user acceptance.},

A respectable amount of work dealing with the technology acceptance model (TAM), from its first appearance more than a quarter of a century ago, clearly indicates a popularity of the model in the field of technology acceptance. Originated in the psychological theory of reasoned action and theory of planned behavior, TAM has evolved to become a key model in understanding predictors of human behavior toward potential acceptance or rejection of the technology. The main aim of the paper is to provide an up-to-date, well-researched resource of past and current references to TAM-related literature and to identify possible directions for future TAM research. The paper presents a comprehensive concept-centric literature review of the TAM, from 1986 onwards. According to a designed methodology, 85 scientific publications have been selected and classified according to their aim and content into three categories such as (i) TAM literature reviews, (ii) development and extension of TAM, and (iii) modification and application of TAM. Despite a continuous progress in revealing new factors with significant influence on TAM’s core variables, there are still many unexplored areas of model potential application that could contribute to its predictive validity. Consequently, four possible future directions for TAM research based on the conducted literature review and analysis are identified and presented.},

	abstract = {The current study aims to establish a connection between students' behavioral concerns, namely stress and anxiety, related to the completion of academic tasks, and their integration of technology using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) through the utilization of Chat-GPT via ubiquitous learning (UL) procedure. To achieve this objective, data was collected from 156 students studying management science who were engaged in their final year research projects or internship reports from selected universities in Pakistan. The gathered data underwent analysis through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using Smart PLS software. The findings reveal a significant relationship: students' stress contributes to the emergence of anxiety, which in turn motivates the adoption of technology-assisted solutions, specifically Chat-GPT, to efficiently complete assigned tasks within deadlines working through any device from anywhere. Consequently, the perceived ease of use and usefulness associated with Chat-GPT's AI-generated text contribute to shaping students' favorable attitudes toward utilizing Chat-GPT and also play a role in reducing their stress levels. Furthermore, the study confirms that the development of a positive attitude in students acts as a driving force, compelling them to engage with Chat-GPT through ubiquitous learning (UL) procedure, ultimately resulting in increased actual usage of Chat-GPT. This pattern, in turn, contributes to stress and anxiety reduction among management science students. The study's outcomes corroborate the TAM model, which aligns with the social exchange process, demonstrating its applicability within the context of the educational setup in management sciences and its potential to enhance the learning experiences of researchers.},

	abstract = {ChatGPT, an AI-powered language model, is revolutionising the academic world. Scholars, researchers, and students use its advanced capabilities to achieve their educational objectives, including generating innovative ideas, delivering assignments, and conducting extensive research projects. Nevertheless, the use of ChatGPT among students is contentious, giving rise to significant apprehensions regarding integrity and AI-facilitated deceit. At the same time, scholarly communities currently need more well-defined standards for adopting such academia-oriented technology. This study aims to determine students' use of ChatGPT using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), notably the role of students' integrity in determining adoption behaviour. The analysis of 921 responses demonstrated that the utilisation of ChatGPT is influenced positively by performance expectancy, social influence, educational self-efficacy, technology self-efficacy, and personal anxiety. Conversely, student integrity was found to negatively impact usage. Remarkably, student integrity has a positive moderating effect between effort expectancy and ChatGPT usage. At the same time, it has a negative moderating effect on the link between performance expectancy and technology self-efficacy with ChatGPT usage. Hence, we propose that the academic community, AI language model developers, publishers, and relevant stakeholders collaborate to establish explicit rules for the utilisation of AI chatbots in an ethical manner for educational purposes.},

	abstract = {This study explored the relationship between the leadership styles adopted by academic librarians and their openness to artificial intelligence (AI). The purpose was to discern whether particular leadership approaches influence librarians' attitudes and acceptance of AI technologies in higher education. Data was collected from 50 librarians across four Arab countries. Two distinct questionnaires were administered to the participants: the first focused on their perceptions of AI, exploring attitudes, beliefs, and understanding of AI technologies, while the second implemented the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ 5×) to assess the librarians' leadership styles. Correlational analysis, inferential statistics including structural equation model, and regression analysis were employed leading to explore the predictive power of various leadership styles on librarians' openness to AI. Findings suggest that the implementation of AI in academic libraries is most likely to occur under transformational leadership, with transactional leadership being associated with suboptimal outcomes; a noteworthy association is observed between the perception of ease of use and the adoption of laissez-faire leadership. The insights derived from this study hold particular significance for the development of librarians' professional training programs, offering valuable guidance on fostering adaptive leadership strategies that align with the evolving landscape of AI integration within academic library settings.},

Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was applied to determine the ability of the UTAUT model antecedent to the proposed method. After eliminating the distorting observed variable, this study used performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions as ‘adoption readiness’. The results of path analysis indicated that (1) anxiety has a significant negative impact on adoption readiness and attitude of university teachers; (2) positive but insignificant impact of resistance to change on adoption readiness and attitude; (3) adoption readiness mediates the relationship between anxiety and attitude while; (4) no mediation role of adoption readiness was found between the relationship of resistance to change and attitude of the university teachers towards an AI-based assessment systems.

Based on the results, the better the data security and privacy of borrowers by the P2P lending platform, the better the perceived usefulness will be. In addition, the better service quality provided by the P2P lending platform will greatly help expedite the process. There was no significant effect of perceived usefulness and behavioral intention on the intention to use the P2Plending platform.

Various factors affect users' utilization of financial technology, with the quality of services offered by FinTech providers standing out as a significant consideration. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the quality of services offered by FinTech payment platforms and the utilization of FinTech services. We develop a novel conceptual model integrating elements from SERVQUAL and TAM (the Technology Acceptance Model) to investigate these dynamics. To gain a comprehensive understanding, we employed a mixed methods research approach. This approach included a quantitative survey analyzed using a partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) to examine the proposed framework and the relationships between its constructs. Following the survey, a follow-up focus group discussion with industry experts and academics was conducted to delve deeper into the findings and explore the "why" behind the statistical relationships. The findings reveal a significant impact of the quality of services offered by FinTech payment service providers on the utilization of such services. It demonstrates that in the FinTech sector, perceived usefulness does not always dominate perceived ease of use. Moreover, it confirms the profound influence of perceived usefulness in shaping attitudes and subsequent behaviour related to technology use. These insights contribute to an enhanced understanding of the factors driving the utilization of FinTech services.},

In this study, we attempted to identify the socioenvironmental and technological factors that influence the adoption of artificial intelligence embedded technology by digital manufacturing and production organizations. In doing so, the extended technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework is used to explore the applicability of Industry 4.0. A conceptual model was proposed that used an integrated technology acceptance model (TAM)-TOE model and was tested using survey-based data collected from 340 employees of small, medium and large organizations. The results highlight that all the relationships, except organizational readiness, organizational compatibility and partner support on perceived ease of use, were found to be significant in the context of digital manufacturing and production organizations.

This study proposes an expanded model based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) that incorporates the characteristics of AICAT users to explore the key factors affecting college students’ willingness to use AICATs. Utilizing a survey methodology, 303 Chinese participants completed the questionnaire. Factor analysis and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) results indicate that users’ dependence worry (DW) about AICATs positively affects perceived risk (PR), which in turn negatively impacts perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU), thus reducing user willingness to use. Dependence concerns also negatively impact perceived trust (PT), while PT positively affects PU and PEOU, thereby enhancing willingness to use. Additionally, a user’s self-efficacy (SE) negatively impacts DW and positively affects PEOU. This study discusses the potential significance of these findings and offers suggestions for AICAT developers to foster and promote widespread use.},

	abstract = {Software engineering research has always being concerned with the improvement of code completion approaches, which suggest the next tokens a developer will likely type while coding. The release of GitHub Copilot constitutes a big step forward, also because of its unprecedented ability to automatically generate even entire functions from their natural language description. While the usefulness of Copilot is evident, it is still unclear to what extent it is robust. Specifically, we do not know the extent to which semantic-preserving changes in the natural language description provided to the model have an effect on the generated code function. In this paper we present an empirical study in which we aim at understanding whether different but semantically equivalent natural language descriptions result in the same recommended function. A negative answer would pose questions on the robustness of deep learning (DL)-based code generators since it would imply that developers using different wordings to describe the same code would obtain different recommendations. We asked Copilot to automatically generate 892 Java methods starting from their original Javadoc description. Then, we generated different semantically equivalent descriptions for each method both manually and automatically, and we analyzed the extent to which predictions generated by Copilot changed. Our results show that modifying the description results in different code recommendations in ∼46\% of cases. Also, differences in the semantically equivalent descriptions might impact the correctness of the generated code (±28\%).},

Through an experiment with 21 participants we focus on code productivity and code quality. For experimental design, a participant was given a project to code, under three conditions presented in a randomized order. The conditions are pair-programming with Copilot, human pair-programming as a driver, and as a navigator. The codes generated from the three trials were analyzed to determine how many lines of code on average were added in each condition and how many lines of code on average were removed in the subsequent stage. The former measures the productivity of each condition while the latter measures the quality of the produced code. The results suggest that although Copilot increases productivity as measured by lines of code added, the quality of code produced is inferior by having more lines of code deleted in the subsequent trial.},

	abstract = {Automatic program synthesis is a long-lasting dream in software engineering. Recently, a promising Deep Learning (DL) based solution, called Copilot, has been proposed by OpenAI and Microsoft as an industrial product. Although some studies evaluate the correctness of Copilot solutions and report its issues, more empirical evaluations are necessary to understand how developers can benefit from it effectively. In this paper, we study the capabilities of Copilot in two different programming tasks: (i) generating (and reproducing) correct and efficient solutions for fundamental algorithmic problems, and (ii) comparing Copilot’s proposed solutions with those of human programmers on a set of programming tasks. For the former, we assess the performance and functionality of Copilot in solving selected fundamental problems in computer science, like sorting and implementing data structures. In the latter, a dataset of programming problems with human-provided solutions is used. The results show that Copilot is capable of providing solutions for almost all fundamental algorithmic problems, however, some solutions are buggy and non-reproducible. Moreover, Copilot has some difficulties in combining multiple methods to generate a solution. Comparing Copilot to humans, our results show that the correct ratio of humans’ solutions is greater than Copilot’s suggestions, while the buggy solutions generated by Copilot require less effort to be repaired. Based on our findings, if Copilot is used by expert developers in software projects, it can become an asset since its suggestions could be comparable to humans’ contributions in terms of quality. However, Copilot can become a liability if it is used by novice developers who may fail to filter its buggy or non-optimal solutions due to a lack of expertise.},

Previous research found that OpenAI's Codex, a natural language machine learning model trained on billions of lines of code, performs well on many programming problems, often generating correct and readable Python code. GitHub's version of Codex, Copilot, is freely available to students. This raises pedagogic and academic integrity concerns. Educators need to know what Copilot is capable of, in order to adapt their teaching to AI-powered programming assistants. Previous research evaluated the most performant Codex model quantitatively, e.g. how many problems have at least one correct suggestion that passes all tests. Here I evaluate Copilot instead, to see if and how it differs from Codex, and look qualitatively at the generated suggestions, to understand the limitations of Copilot. I also report on the experience of using Copilot for other activities asked of students in programming courses: explaining code, generating tests and fixing bugs. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the observed capabilities for the teaching of programming.},

Given a natural language description of the target functionality, Copilot can generate corresponding code in several programming languages. In this paper, we perform an empirical study to evaluate the correctness and understandability of Copilot's suggested code. We use 33 LeetCode questions to create queries for Copilot in four different programming languages. We evaluate the correctness of the corresponding 132 Copilot solutions by running LeetCode's provided tests, and evaluate understandability using SonarQube's cyclomatic complexity and cognitive complexity metrics. We find that Copilot's Java suggestions have the highest correctness score (57\%) while JavaScript is the lowest (27\%). Overall, Copilot's suggestions have low complexity with no notable differences between the programming languages. We also find some potential Copilot shortcomings, such as generating code that can be further simplified and code that relies on undefined helper methods.},

	abstract = {Intelligent systems such as technologies related to artificial intelligence, robotics, machine learning, etc. open new insights into data and expand the concept of work in myriad domains. These technologies, while potentially useful, face high barriers to widespread adoption and acceptance by industries and citizens alike. The complexity and multi-dimensionality inherent in intelligent systems often renders traditional validation efforts (e.g., traceability analysis) impossible. In addition, contexts where predictions or computer-generated recommendations have real-world consequences, such as in medical prognosis, financial investing, or military applications introduce new risks and a host of moral and ethical concerns that can further hinder the widespread adoption of intelligent systems. Naturally, such reluctance by would-be users limits the potential of intelligent systems to solve real-world problems. This article reviews the challenges to technology acceptance through the lens of system transparency and user trust, and extends the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) structure with issues germane to intelligent systems. We examine several prospective transparency frameworks that could be adopted and used by Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) practitioners involved in systems development. Our intention is to assist practitioners in the design of more transparent systems with a specific eye towards enhancing trust and acceptance in intelligent systems. Further, as a result of our review, we suggest that the well-known TAM should be expanded in the context of intelligent systems to include trust and transparency as key elements of the model. Finally, we conclude with a research agenda that might offer empirical evidence showing how transparency might enhance acceptance and use of intelligent systems.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has been proven to be a disruptive financial technology in the context of mobile banking that can provide more practical value to users and banks. AI is a critical way of facilitating user acceptance and adoption of mobile banking applications (apps). Nevertheless, the ways in which AI features influence users’ continuance intention towards AI-enabled mobile banking apps have not been investigated from the perspective of an expectation confirmation model (ECM). To address this research gap, this paper develops a research model by combining two constructs pertaining to AI characteristics, namely, perceived intelligence and perceived anthropomorphism, and by using the ECM to explore users’ continuance intentions in this context. We employed a survey research method using a random sampling approach to collect 365 valid responses. A partial least squares approach was used to examine the model. The results show that both intelligence and anthropomorphism can increase user satisfaction via confirmation and perceived usefulness, which in turn fosters users’ willingness to continue to engage in mobile banking. This paper offers theoretical advancements, discusses future directions for mobile banking research and provides practical guidance to app developers with respect to designing and developing proper mobile banking apps using AI technology.},

The results stress the special importance of attitudinal factors (attitude towards usage and perceived institutional trust) and cognitive instrumental processes (mainly, usefulness perceptions) in determining physicians’ intention to use EHCR systems. Perceptions of institutional trust exerted strong direct effects on physicians’ perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and attitude towards the use of EHCR systems.

	abstract = {SEM has potential advantages over linear regression models that make SEM a priori the methods of choice in analyzing path diagrams when these involve latent variables with multiple indicators. What SEM does is to integrate the measurements and the hypothesized causal paths into a simultaneous assessment. SEM can analyze many stages of independent and dependent variables, including, in the case of CBSEM, the error terms, into one unified model. This one unified measurement and structural model is then estimated, either together as in CBSEM or iteratively as in PLS, and the results are presented as one unified model in which the path estimates of both the measurement and the structural models are presented as a whole. CBSEM, in contrast, addresses the problem of measurement error by explicitly modeling measurement error variance/covariance structures and relying on a factor analytic measurement model.},

This practical open access guide provides a step-by-step treatment of the major choices in analyzing PLS path models using R, a free software environment for statistical computing, which runs on Windows, macOS, and UNIX computer platforms. Adopting the R software’s SEMinR package, which brings a friendly syntax to creating and estimating structural equation models, each chapter offers a concise overview of relevant topics and metrics, followed by an in-depth description of a case study. Simple instructions give readers the “how-tos” of using SEMinR to obtain solutions and document their results. Rules of thumb in every chapter provide guidance on best practices in the application and interpretation of PLS-SEM.},

A drawback of the commonly applied chi-square test, in addition to the known problems related to sample size and power, is that it may indicate an increasing correspondence between the hypothesized model and the observed data as both the measurement properties and the relationship between constructs decline. Further, and contrary to common assertion, the risk of making a Type II error can be substantial even when the sample size is large. To overcome these problems, a testing system was developed and applied based on measures of shared variance within the structural, measurement, and overall models.

These tools recommend inserting chunks of code, with the lines to be inserted presented inline at the current cursor location as gray text. In contrast to their popularity, other AI-driven code recommendation tools that suggest code changes (as opposed to code completions) have remained woefully underused. We conducted lab studies at Microsoft to understand this disparity and found one major cause: discoverability. Code change suggestions are hard to surface through bold, inline interfaces and hence, developers often do not even notice them.Towards a systematic understanding of code change interfaces, we performed a thorough design exploration for various categories of code changes: additive single-line changes, single-line changes, and multi-line changes. Overall, we explored 19 designs through a series of 7 laboratory studies involving 61 programmers and distilled our findings into a set of 5 design principles. To validate our results, we built and deployed a new version of IntelliCode with two of our new inline interfaces in Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 and found that they lead to a significant increase in usage of the corresponding tools.},

In this paper, we describe findings from a two-stage qualitative investigation. We first interviewed 17 developers to contextualize their notions of trust and understand their challenges in building appropriate trust in AI code generation tools. We surfaced three main challenges -- including building appropriate expectations, configuring AI tools, and validating AI suggestions. To address these challenges, we conducted a design probe study in the second stage to explore design concepts that support developers' trust-building process by 1) communicating AI performance to help users set proper expectations, 2) allowing users to configure AI by setting and adjusting preferences, and 3) offering indicators of model mechanism to support evaluation of AI suggestions. We gathered developers' feedback on how these design concepts can help them build appropriate trust in AI-powered code generation tools, as well as potential risks in design. These findings inform our proposed design recommendations on how to design for trust in AI-powered code generation tools.},

	abstract = {Engagement with e-portfolios has been shown to improve students’ learning. However, what influences students to accept e-portfolios is a question that needs careful study. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of Self-Efficacy, Subjective Norm, Enjoyment, Computer Anxiety and Experience on students’ Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) and Perceived Usefulness (PU) of an e-portfolio system and their Behavioural Intention (BI) to use the system for learning. To do this, the study tested and used the General Extended Technology Acceptance Model for E-Learning (GETAMEL) in the context of e-portfolios. Valid data were collected from 242 UK undergraduate students who had been introduced to e-portfolios. The data set was analysed using SPSS software. Results showed that the best predictor of student’s Perceived Ease of Use of the e-portfolio is Experience, followed by Enjoyment, Self-Efficacy and Subjective Norm. The best predictor of student’s Perceived Usefulness of the e-portfolio is Perceived Ease of Use followed by Enjoyment. Both Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Usefulness predict student’s Behavioural Intention to Use the e-portfolio. The findings improve understanding regarding acceptance of e-portfolio systems and this work is therefore of particular interest to researchers, developers and practitioners of e-portfolios.},

Over the years, acceptance researchers have become more interested in understanding the factors influencing the adoption of technologies in various settings. From the literature, much research has been done to understand technology acceptance in the business contexts. This is understandable, given the close relationship between the appropriate uses of technology and profit margin. In most of the acceptance studies, researchers have sought to identify and understand the forces that shape users’ acceptance so as to influence the design and implementation process in ways to avoid or minimize resistance or rejection when users interact with technology. This has given rise to the identification of core technological and psychological variables underlying acceptance. From these, models of acceptance have emerged, some extending the theories from psychology with a focus on the attitude-intention paradigm in explaining technology usage, and allowing researchers to predict user acceptance of potential technology applications.},

	abstract = {Computer systems cannot improve organizational performance if they aren't used. Unfortunately, resistance to end-user systems by managers and professionals is a widespread problem. To better predict, explain, and increase user acceptance, we need to better understand why people accept or reject computers. This research addresses the ability to predict peoples' computer acceptance from a measure of their intentions, and the ability to explain their intentions in terms of their attitudes, subjective norms, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and related variables. In a longitudinal study of 107 users, intentions to use a specific system, measured after a one-hour introduction to the system, were correlated 0.35 with system use 14 weeks later. The intention-usage correlation was 0.63 at the end of this time period. Perceived usefulness strongly influenced peoples' intentions, explaining more than half of the variance in intentions at the end of 14 weeks. Perceived ease of use had a small but significant effect on intentions as well, although this effect subsided over time. Attitudes only partially mediated the effects of these beliefs on intentions. Subjective norms had no effect on intentions. These results suggest the possibility of simple but powerful models of the determinants of user acceptance, with practical value for evaluating systems and guiding managerial interventions aimed at reducing the problem of underutilized computer technology.},

A sample of 171 faculty members from three higher education institutions in Midwestern United States is utilized for the purpose of this study. Using exploratory path analysis, twelve hypotheses were tested for the learning management system. The results of the analyses reveal that perceived quality of teaching plays a significant role in the faculty members' consideration to use learning management systems. In turn, peer influence does not appear to predict 488 Salajan, Welch, Ray, and Peterson faculty perceptions of the system's usefulness for teaching.

Model constructs were measured at three points in time at each organization: preimplementation, one month postimplementation, and three months postimplementation. The extended model was strongly supported for all four organizations at all three points of measurement, accounting for 40\%--60\% of the variance in usefulness perceptions and 34\%--52\% of the variance in usage intentions. Both social influence processes (subjective norm, voluntariness, and image) and cognitive instrumental processes (job relevance, output quality, result demonstrability, and perceived ease of use) significantly influenced user acceptance.

From an organizational point of view, however, the more important issue is how managers make informed decisions about interventions that can lead to greater acceptance and effective utilization of IT. There is limited research in the IT implementation literature that deals with the role of interventions to aid such managerial decision making. Particularly, there is a need to understand how various interventions can influence the known determinants of IT adoption and use. To address this gap in the literature, we draw from the vast body of research on the technology acceptance model (TAM), particularly the work on the determinants of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, and: (i) develop a comprehensive nomological network (integrated model) of the determinants of individual level (IT) adoption and use; (ii) empirically test the proposed integrated model; and (iii) present a research agenda focused on potential pre- and postimplementation interventions that can enhance employees' adoption and use of IT. Our findings and research agenda have important implications for managerial decision making on IT implementation in organizations.},

Mini-detail short videos can be conceptualized as multimedia effects, virtual experiences, and product personalized recommendations. Therefore, the discussion of mini-detail short videos and consumer purchase intention is transformed into the discussion of multimedia effects, virtual experience, product personalized recommendation and consumer purchase intention. In this study, a research model based on TAM2 is proposed. A total of 168 valid questionnaires were collected using the questionnaire method. AMOS structural equation model23.0 and spss23.0 were used to analyze the reliability and validity of the questionnaire data. The results show that perceived playfulness and perceived usefulness partially mediate the relationship between multimedia effect, virtual experience, personalized product recommendation and consumers purchase intention. Obviously, multimedia effects, virtual experience and personalized product recommendations are the main factors that affect consumers shopping intentions. Notably, this study found that perceived playfulness was more important than perceived usefulness in influencing customers purchase intention. Based on these findings, the conclusions of this thesis will enable Tao bao merchants and platform managers to identify the mechanism of the impact of mini-detail short videos on consumer purchase intention.},

A total of 475 usable self-administered questionnaires were collected, and the results showed that only the relationship between the image and perceived usefulness (PU) was not supported. As per Model B, the ranking of subjective norms (SN) and PU between the PLS-SEM and ANN model does not match each other, implying that hidden attributes may exist in affecting the role of SN and PU under the practical context of which the relationship between variables may not fully be explained by a linear perspective. The finding is beneficial for advertising practitioners and software developers who wish to optimize BTA results. Theoretically, the study extends TAM2 in the context of advertising, which is a neglected research area. Methodologically, the study is the first to apply TAM2 using the hybrid PLS-SEM-ANN in the context of advertising.},

	abstract = {Biological control (BC) strategies have bolstered the ability and motivation of farmers to control various types of pests, but better understanding of farmers' behaviour for BC acceptance is still needed. This study attempted for the first time to implement an extended version of the technology acceptance model (TAM) that combined innovation diffusion theory (IDT), perceived self-efficacy, and facilitating conditions to investigate factors affecting farmers' acceptance and use of BC for the control of rice stem borer [Chilo suppressalis (Walker)] in rice fields of Mazandaran province in northern Iran. The proposed model (widely known as TAM2) was empirically tested using data collected from a survey of 179 rice farmers. The TAM2 explained 78\% of the variance in behavioural intention of farmers to use BC and 82\% of the variance in actual use. With the TAM2, adoption and use of BC could be adequately predicted from farmers' intentions, which were affected by perceived self-efficacy, facilitating conditions, compatibility, and perceived usefulness as the original TAM suggests. Therefore, with the TAM2 we successfully extended the TAM (in terms of model fit) by including three external factors relevant to BC, namely, perceived self-efficacy, facilitating conditions, and compatibility as antecedents of behavioural intention to use. However, the predicted direct and indirect effects of perceived ease of use on farmers' behavioural intention were not supported. The TAM2 outperformed the original TAM in predicting farmer's intention to use BC in farm practices and consequently actual use. To increase acceptance of BC, agricultural authorities should take care of creating a favorable environment which will support and encourage the use of BC at the farm level. Providing facilitating conditions, such as extension services and training, can help farmers to increase their knowledge about BC. However, more emphasis should be given on compatibility and usefulness of this technology and less on the ease of use.},

	abstract = {Information technology (IT) acceptance research has yielded many competing models, each with different sets of acceptance determinants. In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.},

This study aims to investigate the behavioral intention (BI) to use blockchain by extending the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, incorporating subjective and objective knowledge, trust in technology, and information literacy. The proposed structural model was assessed by partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) using the data from 275 senior managers of Iranian poultry supply chains. The results showed that effort expectancy and performance expectancy were the most influential variables in predicting the BI to use blockchain technology, respectively. Furthermore, objective knowledge had an impact on the intention to use blockchain. However, subjective knowledge was not found to have any effect. The proposed model including the moderating effects of trust in technology and information literacy showed a higher predictive power. Trust in technology moderated the relationship between performance expectancy and behavioral intention, and information literacy moderated the relationship between technical infrastructure, as one of the facilitating conditions, and behavioral intention. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed in the paper.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to identify the factors impacting medical professionals’ adoption intention of AI-based innovative medical devices focused on the mediating role of trust. Drawing on the UTAUT model, we examined the mediating effect of trust in the relationships between these factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and social influence). This study collected survey data through convenient sampling from 248 medical professionals working in medical institutions located in the metropolitan areas in Republic of Korea. The result showed that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and social influence have a positive impact on trust, and this trust, in turn, has a significant influence on acceptance intentions. The results emphasize that the success of introducing innovative medical devices in institutions hinges not only on the devices' innovation level but also on the psychological factors of the professionals. By taking into account these factors and building trust, medical institutions can elevate service quality and efficiency, fostering greater acceptance of advanced medical devices.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Prior research has provided valuable insights into how and why employees make a decision about the adoption and use of information technologies (ITs) in the workplace. From an organizational point of view, however, the more important issue is how managers make informed decisions about interventions that can lead to greater acceptance and effective utilization of IT. There is limited research in the IT implementation literature that deals with the role of interventions to aid such managerial decision making. Particularly, there is a need to understand how various interventions can influence the known determinants of IT adoption and use. To address this gap in the literature, we draw from the vast body of research on the technology acceptance model (TAM), particularly the work on the determinants of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, and: (i) develop a comprehensive nomological network (integrated model) of the determinants of individual level (IT) adoption and use; (ii) empirically test the proposed integrated model; and (iii) present a research agenda focused on potential pre- and postimplementation interventions that can enhance employees' adoption and use of IT. Our findings and research agenda have important implications for managerial decision making on IT implementation in organizations.},

Based on TAM3 theory, the study proposes a theoretical framework, and then examines its perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use to explain the individual’s adoption intentions toward mobile commerce. This study also investigates the moderation role of gender difference and individualism-collectivism measured at individual-level on the adoption of mobile commerce. Data were collected from a 14 private Jordanian universities using a paper-based questionnaire. The analysis involves 425 valid data sets. The empirical findings conclude that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are important factors in explaining the individual’s intention to adopt mobile commerce. The findings also demonstrate the impact of self-efficacy and perceptions of external control determinants on the perceptions of ease of use and the impact of image and output quality determinants on the perceptions of usefulness. The results reveal that the moderation role of individualism-collectivism at individual-level values on the adoption of mobile commerce is significant. But the gender does not have any moderation effect on the adoption process. This model explained 41\% of the variance in intention to adopt mobile commerce. Implications and recommendations for research and practice are presented and discussed.},

Different factors influence early adopters of innovations and mass market representatives’ perceptions of the usefulness of social robots. The first aim of the study was to test how applicable the technology acceptance model 3 (TAM3) is in the context of social robots. Participants’ acceptance of social robotics in a workplace environment in the fuzzy front-end (FFE) innovation phase of a robot development project was examined. Based on the findings for the model, we developed a reduced version of the TAM3 that is more applicable for social robots. The second objective was to analyze how early adopters’ and mass market representatives’ acceptance of social robots differs. Quantitative research methods were used. For early adopters, result demonstrability has a significant influence on perceived usefulness of social robots, while for mass market representatives, perceived enjoyment has a more significant influence on perceived usefulness. The findings indicate that users’ innovation adoption style influences the factors that users consider important in the usefulness of social robots. Robot developers should take these into account during the FFE innovation phase.},

The findings revealed that usefulness, convenience of use, and push-to-use were the most critical aspects for achieving an efficient public e-tourism system that allows for value co-creation in that order of ranking. The findings also suggest that computer self-efficiency is the most critical factor in effectively establishing an e-tourism system followed by government push-to-use. In conclusion, the findings demonstrate that usefulness and ease-of-use backed by computer self-efficiency, result demonstrability, and output quality are vital for the efficient adoption of a public e-tourism system resulting in value co-creation in the UAE.},

The system combines a structural time series model for the target series with a regression component capturing the contributions of contemporaneous search query data. A spike-and-slab prior on the regression coefficients induces sparsity, dramatically reducing the size of the regression problem. Our system averages over potential contributions from a very large set of models and gives easily digested reports of which coefficients are likely to be important. We illustrate with applications to initial claims for unemployment benefits and to retail sales. Although our exposition focuses on using search engine data to forecast economic time series, the underlying statistical methods can be applied to more general short term forecasting with large numbers of contemporaneous predictors.},

Second hand cars are in high demand but the process for evaluating their value is flawed which may lead them to be priced at unrealistic rates. Here, we offer our contribution for this issue. In this paper, an ensemble machine learning approach, XG Boost is proposed, which takes the important features of a car into account and assigns the cost based on it. Our proposed system uses multiple gradient boosted trees which minimizes the overfitting and eliminates irregularities from the predictions. Further, the accuracies for different machine learning algorithms such as Linear regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, KNN, and CART are calculated and compared with our model. From experimental results, major factors which contributed towards the car prices are found to be year of manufacture, distance driven, fuel type and transmission. The proposed approach contributes promising results in forecasting the resale value of the car, and achieves an accuracy of 93.73\%.},

The average on-road life of cars in India is high, exceeding twenty years and pass through multiple hands. The price of old cars is also a primary determinant of the prices of new cars. The article discusses the non-linear reduction of used car prices on account of age, kilometer driven, and the number of previous owners of the cars. In addition to using the Ordinary Linear Squares (OLS), we also applied Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) techniques to capture non-linear price relationships with other depreciating variables. The resulting error estimation from these two methods demonstrates that the complexity of non-linear modeling using MARS significantly improves fitment accuracy.},

An empirical study is performed to explore the contributions of different degrees of freedom in the modeling process to the forecast accuracy. First, a comparative analysis of alternative prediction methods provides evidence that random forest regression is particularly effective for resale price forecasting. It is also shown that the use of linear regression, the prevailing method in previous work, should be avoided. Second, the empirical results demonstrate the presence of heterogeneity in resale price forecasting and identify methods that can automatically overcome its detrimental effect on the forecast accuracy. Finally, the study confirms that the sellers of used cars possess informational advantages over market research agencies, which enable them to forecast resale prices more accurately. This implies that sellers have an incentive to invest in in-house forecasting solutions, instead of basing their pricing decisions on externally generated residual value estimates.},

	abstract = {A global consensus has been reached that promotes full electrification in the automotive field to solve environmental problems, and Electric Vehicles (EVs) have developed rapidly in recent years. China has gradually promoted electrification for taxis, trucks, and private cars. Due to the large number of electric private cars (EPCs), the evolutionary impact of EPC ownership on the charging demand and even the power grid at different stages cannot be ignored. But the evolution of EPC ownership is affected by many factors, and the prediction accuracy is low. Thus, an evolution prediction method of EPC ownership considering the decision-making behaviour of consumers is proposed. Firstly, considering the mutual influence of the individual mental state of consumers for EPC, the social network of consumers is generated based on the small-world network model. Secondly, to simulate the psychological state of consumers and decision-making behaviour, a consumer-state decision model is built based on the Markov chain. Considering the influence of multiple factors on the individual decision-making behaviour of consumers, transfer indicators are constructed to quantify the transfer of states of consumers. Then, combined with the historical data, the development of EPC ownership is predicted. Finally, the effectiveness of the prediction method is verified based on the Shanghai EPC ownership. Compared with other methods, the prediction accuracy of the proposed method is improved by 6.4\%, and the evolution of EPC ownership in Chinese different regions can be quantified to provide a basis for related research.},

	abstract = {Ngày nay, học máy được sử dụng rộng rãi trong nhiều lĩnh vực như thương mại điện tử, chứng khoán, y học. Dữ liệu được thu thập cho những vấn đề này là rất lớn và việc huấn luyện các mô hình dự đoán đòi hỏi rất nhiều thời gian. Dẫn đến sự ra đời của các kỹ thuật và công nghệ mới phù hợp để xử lý dữ liệu lớn. Trong dự án này, chúng tôi sẽ sử dụng BigQuery Machine Learning (BigQuery ML) để giải quyết vấn đề dự đoán quyết định mua hàng của người tiêu dùng. Các mô hình được sử dụng để đào tạo bao gồm các mô hình hồi quy logistic và rừng ngẫu nhiên. Chúng tôi sẽ đánh giá độ chính xác, chi phí và đề xuất một số ý kiến trong việc sử dụng BigQuery ML cho các bài toán dự đoán quyết định mua hàng. Từ khóa: dữ liệu lớn, BigQuery, học máy, dự đoán, quyết định mua hàng 1. Giới thiệu 1.1. Bài toán dự đoán quyết định mua hàng Trong mô hình học có giám sát thường có hai bài toán chính: bài toán dự đoán (đối với biến mục tiêu liên tục) và bài toán phân loại (đối với biến mục tiêu rời rạc). Tuy nhiên, đối với một số bài toán phân loại có ít lớp, chẳng hạn với 2 lớp, ta có thể biến đổi sang bài toán dự đoán xác suất thuộc một lớp nào đó. Trong dự án này, dựa trên thông tin thu thập được về lượt truy cập của khách hàng, chúng ta cần phân lớp các giá trị thành 0, 1. Trong đó, giá trị 1 khi khách hàng quyết định thêm sản phẩm thì sẽ được thêm vào giỏ hàng, ngược lại sẽ có có giá trị bằng 0. Tuy nhiên, thay vì phân lớp chính xác ngay từ đầu, chúng ta dự đoán tỷ lệ khách hàng quyết định lựa chọn sản phẩm. Tỷ lệ này sẽ có giá trị từ 0 đến 1, từ tỷ lệ này chúng ta lựa chọn một ngưỡng phù hợp để đưa ra quyết định cuối cùng về lớp phân loại. Dựa trên các thông tin truy cập vào các trang thương mại điện tử, được thu thập từ người truy cập. Các thông tin có thể bao gồm: thời gian, địa điểm, số trang đã duyệt, tổng số lần truy cập, phương tiện sử dụng, thiết bị sử dụng ….. Chúng ta có thể dự đoán xem khách truy cập có ra quyết định mua hàng hay không bằng cách xây dựng các mô hình dự đoán. 2. Phương pháp 2.1. BigQuery BigQuery là kho dữ liệu doanh nghiệp không có máy chủ và tiết kiệm chi phí. Chức năng chính của BigQuery là kích hoạt các truy vấn phân tích tương tác trên dữ liệu lớn (Tigani \& Naidu, 2014). BigQuery ML cho phép các nhà khoa học dữ liệu và nhà phân tích dữ liệu xây dựng, vận hành các mô hình học máy trên dữ liệu có cấu trúc và bán cấu trúc. BigQuery ML tích hợp các mô hình học máy, sử dụng các câu lệnh SQL đơn giản và có thời gian truy xuất nhanh. Sau quá trình huấn luyện, chúng ta có thể sử dụng các mô hình để dự đoán thông qua Vertex AI hoặc tích hợp vào ác dự án cá nhân (BigQuery, 2022).},

We took 20 data sets available from UCI repository [1] containing instances varying from 148 to 20000. We compared the classification results obtained from methods i.e. Random Forest and Decision Tree (J48). The classification parameters consist of correctly classified instances, incorrectly classified instances, F-Measure, Precision, Accuracy and Recall. We discussed the pros and cons of using these models for large and small data sets. The classification results show that Random Forest gives better results for the same number of attributes and large data sets i.e. with greater number of instances, while J48 is handy with small data sets (less number of instances). The results from breast cancer data set depicts that when the number of instances increased from 286 to 699, the percentage of correctly classified instances increased from 69.23\% to 96.13\% for Random Forest i.e. for dataset with same number of attributes but having more instances, the Random Forest accuracy increased.},

Due to their potential for handling huge datasets, feed-forward neural networks with random weights (FNNRWs) have drawn a lot of attention. In this paper, we introduced an efficient feed-forward neural network scheme (FNNS) for processing massive datasets with random weights. The FNNS divides large-scale data into subsets of the same size, and each subset derives the corresponding submodel. According to the activation function, the optimal range of input weights and biases is calculated. The input weight and biases are randomly generated in this range, and the iterative scheme is used to evaluate the output weight. The MNIST dataset was used as the basis for experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm has a promising future in processing massive datasets.},

In terms of quantifying average error, however, absolute-value-based measures such as the mean absolute error (MAE) are more interpretable than MSE or RMSE. Part of that historical preference for sums-of-squares measures is that they are mathematically amenable to decomposition and one can then form ratios, such as those based on separating MSE into its systematic and unsystematic components. Here, we develop and illustrate a decomposition of MAE into three useful submeasures: (1) bias error, (2) proportionality error, and (3) unsystematic error. This three-part decomposition of MAE is preferable to comparable decompositions of MSE because it provides more straightforward information on the nature of the model-error distribution. We illustrate the properties of our new three-part decomposition using a long-term reconstruction of streamflow for the Upper Colorado River.},

RMSE is inappropriate because it is a function of 3 characteristics of a set of errors, rather than of one (the average error). RMSE varies with the variability within the distribution of error magnitudes and with the square root of the number of errors (n1/2), as well as with the average-error magnitude (MAE). Our findings indicate that MAE is a more natural measure of average error, and (unlike RMSE) is unambiguous. Dimensioned evaluations and inter-comparisons of average model-performance error, therefore, should be based on MAE.},

	abstract = {In the design of a large deployable mesh reflector, high surface accuracy is one of ultimate goals since it directly determines overall performance of the reflector. Therefore, evaluation of surface accuracy is needed in many cases of design and analysis of large deployable mesh reflectors. The surface accuracy is usually specified as root-mean-square error, which measures deviation of a mesh geometry from a desired working surface. In this paper, methods of root-mean-square error calculation for large deployable mesh reflectors are reviewed. Concept of reflector gain, which describes reflector performance, and its relationship with the root-mean-square error is presented. Approaches to prediction or estimation of root-mean-square error in preliminary design of a large deployable mesh reflector are shown. Three methods of root-mean-square error calculation for large deployable mesh reflectors, namely, the nodal deviation root-mean-square error, the best-fit surface root-mean-square error, and the direct root-mean-square error, are presented. Concept of effective region is introduced. An adjusted calculation of root-mean-square error is suggested when the concept of effective region is involved. Finally, these reviewed methods of root-mean-square error calculation are applied to surface accuracy evaluation of a two-facet mesh geometry, a center-feed mesh reflector, and an offset-feed mesh reflector for demonstration and comparison.},

Their paper has been widely cited and may have influenced many researchers in choosing MAE when presenting their model evaluation statistics. However, we contend that the proposed avoidance of RMSE and the use of MAE is not the solution to the problem. In this technical note, we demonstrate that the RMSE is not ambiguous in its meaning, contrary to what was claimed by Willmott et al. (2009). The RMSE is more appropriate to represent model performance than the MAE when the error distribution is expected to be Gaussian. In addition, we show that the RMSE satisfies the triangle inequality requirement for a distance metric.},

This study demonstrated R ² substantially overstates the true PVE. When the assumptions of linear regression are met, R ² overstates PVE by up to 100\%. For instance, when R ² is 0.99, 0.80, 0.50, or 0.10, the true PVE is 0.9, 0.55, 0.29, or 0.05, respectively. The misinterpretation of R ² , which greatly exaggerates the effect of the interventions or causes on the outcomes, could exert undue influence on clinical decisions in medicine and policy decisions in other fields such as environmental protection and climate change research.

Furthermore, it's the algorithm to look up two dictionaries simultaneously with least database storage in the post-processing in order to increase the recognition accuracy. The results of our approach on recognizing Vietnamese handwriting such as name, birthplace and birthday are also presented. By using Vietnamese Personal Name Dictionary for post-processing, the recognition accuracy for Vietnamese characters, words, person name is 91.23\%, 85.41\% and 96.03\% in comparison with 75\% 79.67\% and 77.81\% from common methods correlatively. The statistics are based on 2384, 2248 and 302 testing samples of Vietnamese character, words and personal name respectively. The recognition accuracy for province/city name is 99.8\% among 64 provinces of Vietnam. Our approach is embedded into the automatic data entry system for enrollment forms, VnHandwritten1.0, the first commercial application in recognizing Vietnamese handwriting in Vietnam. On this application, our method proves itself an efficient method for commercial purpose.},

of this study's thorough assessment. A popular solution for automating web application testing that works with a variety of
operating systems and browsers is Selenium WebDriver. Aspects of Selenium WebDriver's performance that are evaluated
include responsiveness across a variety of browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, as well as execution speed
and resource usage. Test execution consistency, managing asynchronous web elements, and robustness in a range of network
situations are all used to evaluate reliability. The ease of setup, connection with continuous integration/continuous deployment
(CI/CD) pipelines, learning curve, and the caliber of documentation and community assistance are all taken into account when
evaluating usability. The study finds that although Selenium WebDriver has strong cross-browser support and a high degree
of reliability, its performance can differ greatly depending on browser-specific implementations. This is demonstrated through
comprehensive benchmarking and real-world test scenarios. Furthermore, the usability analysis shows that although Selenium is
very expandable and adaptable, its complexity and the need for advanced programming abilities may be a barrier for novices. The
results show possible areas for Selenium WebDriver improvement and are intended to assist developers and QA professionals in
making well-informed decisions when choosing a solution for cross-browser test automation.},

	abstract = {Selenium WebDriver is a framework used to control web browsers automatically. It provides a cross-browser Application Programming Interface (API) for different languages (e.g., Java, Python, or JavaScript) that allows automatic navigation, user impersonation, and verification of web applications. Internally, Selenium WebDriver makes use of the native automation support of each browser. Hence, a platform-dependent binary file (the so-called driver) must be placed between the Selenium WebDriver script and the browser to support this native communication. The management (i.e., download, setup, and maintenance) of these drivers is cumbersome for practitioners. This paper provides a complete methodology to automate this management process. Particularly, we present WebDriverManager, the reference tool implementing this methodology. WebDriverManager provides different execution methods: as a Java dependency, as a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool, as a server, as a Docker container, and as a Java agent. To provide empirical validation of the proposed approach, we surveyed the WebDriverManager users. The aim of this study is twofold. First, we assessed the extent to which WebDriverManager is adopted and used. Second, we evaluated the WebDriverManager API following Clarke’s usability dimensions.

Software testing is a tedious, laborious and most time-consuming process. Automation tools have been developed that help to automate some activities of the testing process to enhance quality and timely delivery. Over time with the inclusion of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, automation tools are becoming less effective. The testing community is turning to AI to fill the gap as AI is able to check the code for bugs and errors without any human intervention and in a much faster way than humans. In this study, we aim to recognize the impact of AI technologies on various software testing activities or facets in the STLC. Further, the study aims to recognize and explain some of the biggest challenges software testers face while applying AI to testing.

	abstract = {Over the past few years, artificial intelligence (AI) has made remarkable strides in various domains, transforming the way we live, work, and interact. The rapid advancement of AI technologies has significantly impacted numerous industries Czarnitzki et al (2022).  As AI systems continue to evolve, they offer potential solutions to enhance productivity by automating repetitive tasks, assisting in decision-making, and providing intelligent insights.  In the end of 2022 OpenAi released ChatGPT – AI-driven language model which immediately captured the attention of the world, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in generating human-like text, providing valuable assistance in numerous tasks.  Giving that it is a recent development, there is a pressing need to examine its impact on productivity in software development. Understanding how AI-driven language models like ChatGPT can be integrated into software development workflows and the benefits they may offer can help organizations optimize their processes, enhance efficiency, and ultimately, achieve greater success in the competitive landscape.  This study is timely and relevant as it seeks to address the knowledge gap by examining the effects of ChatGPT on productivity in software development through a survey-based analysis.   The aim of this research is to investigate the impact of implementing artificial intelligence, particularly ChatGPT, on productivity during various stages of software development processes.   The research gathered data from professionals holding various roles within different organizations and employed statistical analysis methods such as correlations and ANOVA to derive meaningful insights.  The primary means of data collection was an online survey, which encompassed a combination of closed-ended and open-ended questions. This survey was conducted over a span of five months, from March to July 2023, and involved the exchange of more than 3000 messages, resulting in 150 valuable responses.  Findings indicate that ChatGPT's influence on productivity varies across different stages of the software development process. Notably, in the requirements gathering and code generation stages, ChatGPT exhibited its most profound impact. These findings highlight ChatGPT's potential to streamline the initial phases of development, where clear documentation and code generation are crucial. However, in testing and debugging stages, the impact was relatively less pronounced.  The findings of this study can contribute to the ongoing discourse on AI's role in software development, informing practitioners and researchers alike on the potential benefits of implementing AI technologies in the industry.},

	abstract = {This study presents a global analysis of the potential exposure of occupations and tasks to Generative AI, and specifically to Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPTs), and the possible implications of such exposure for job quantity and quality. It uses the GPT-4 model to estimate task-level scores of potential exposure and then estimates potential employment effects at the global level as well as by country income group. Despite representing an upper-bound estimate of exposure, we find that only the broad occupation of clerical work is highly exposed to the technology with 24 per cent of clerical tasks considered highly exposed and an additional 58 percent with medium-level exposure. For the other occupational groups, the greatest share of highly exposed tasks oscillates between 1 and 4 per cent, and medium exposed tasks do not exceed 25 per cent. As a result, the most important impact of the technology is likely to be of augmenting work – automating some tasks within an occupation while leaving time for other duties – as opposed to fully automating occupations.The potential employment effects, whether augmenting or automating, vary widely across country income groups, due to different occupational structures. In low-income countries, only 0.4 per cent of total employment is potentially exposed to automation effects, whereas in high-income countries the share rises to 5.5 percent. The effects are highly gendered, with more than double the share of women potentially affected by automation. The greater impact is from augmentation, which has the potential to affect 10.4 percent of employment in low-income countries and 13.4 percent of employment in high-income countries. However, such effects do not consider infrastructure constraints, which will impede the possibility for use in lower-income countries and likely increase the productivity gap.We stress that the primary value of this analysis is not the precise estimates, but rather the insights that the overall distribution of such scores provides about the nature of possible changes. Such insights can encourage governments and social partners to proactively design policies that support orderly, fair, and consultative transitions, rather than dealing with change in a reactive manner. Moreover, the likely ramifications on job quality might be of greater consequence than the quantitative impacts, both with respect to the new jobs created because of the technology, but also the potential effects on work intensity and autonomy when the technology is integrated into the workplace. For this reason, we also emphasize the need for social dialogue and regulation to support quality employment.},

AI is likely to substitute both, routine and nonroutine tasks. It is expected that humans and robots would work together in ways never imaginable. Changes in employability skills are expected. Because of the magnitude of these impacts on jobs, consulted reports call for concerted solutions that go beyond organizations’ and industry’s boundaries to include other relevant stakeholders. Moreover, organizations will have to rethink their human resource (HR) function to realign its expertise to the reality of AI.,In this context, the HR function will have to understand the dynamics that generate the impacts of these technologies in a workplace, to anticipate changes and actively contribute to creating an organizational environment that will facilitate the collaboration between human workers and complex digital agents, while ensuring compliance with labor and employment laws and supporting strategic organizational objectives.,This paper contributes to the debate on ongoing concerns by providing a synthesis of relevant professional literature.},

As a virtual workforce, this software application has proven valuable to organizations looking to automate repetitive, low-added-value work. The combination of RPA and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is called CRPA (Cognitive Robotic Process Automation) or IPA (Intelligent Process Automation) and has led to the next generation of RPA bots. It has been transforming the banking industry by making the core financial operations exponentially more efficient and allowing banks to tailor services to customers while at the same time improving safety and security. Although intelligent automation is enabling banks to redefine how they work, it has also raised challenges regarding protection of both consumer interests and the stability of the financial system. This article presents a case study on Deutsche Bank’s successful implementation of intelligent automation and also discusses the ethical responsibilities and challenges related to automation and employment.

The method is built on the PhoBERT model, a variant of BERT optimized for Vietnamese. Data was collected from opinion surveys of learners at the Ho Chi Minh City campus of the University of Transport and Communications to train and test the model. The system is designed to analyze text and recognize seven basic emotions: enjoyment, trust, hope, sadness, surprise, fear, and others. Corresponding emojis are then assigned to each emotion type to more clearly illustrate the learners' emotional states. Experimental results show that combining PhoBERT and emojis not only enhances the accuracy of emotion recognition but also makes communication more intuitive and vivid. The model achieved an accuracy of 74.1\%. The paper also discusses practical applications of this system in the field of education, where teachers can quickly and accurately understand and respond to students' emotions, thereby improving teaching effectiveness.},

	title = {What is {ChatGPT}?},
	abstract = {ChatGPT is a conversational language model developed by OpenAI. It is part of the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) family of models, which are based on the Transformer architecture and trained on vast amounts of text data to generate human-like text. ChatGPT is designed to generate text in response to an input prompt, making it well suited for conversational applications such as chatbots, customer service agents, and virtual assistants. The model has been trained on a diverse range of conversational data, including websites, books, and social media, allowing it to generate text that is coherent, contextually relevant, and often similar to text produced by humans. To use ChatGPT, a user provides an input prompt, such as a question or statement, which is then fed into the model. The model then generates a response based on its understanding of the input and its training data. The model can generate multiple responses for a single input, and the responses can vary in length, style, and content depending on the context of the input. One of the key strengths of ChatGPT is its ability to generate text that is contextually relevant to the input prompt. For example, if a user asks a question about the weather, ChatGPT can generate a response that includes relevant information about the weather, such as temperature, precipitation, and wind conditions. If the user then asks a follow-up question, ChatGPT can use the previous conversation as context to generate a response that is relevant to the previous conversation. ChatGPT can also generate text that is coherent and flows well, allowing it to participate in longer conversations. The model has been trained on a large amount of conversational data, and has learned how to generate text that is grammatically correct, uses appropriate vocabulary and tone, and is coherent with the input prompt and the overall conversation. In addition to generating text, ChatGPT can also be used for other NLP tasks such as question answering, summarization, and text classification. The model has been fine-tuned on specific tasks, allowing it to perform well on these tasks while still retaining its ability to generate human-like text. ChatGPT is part of a larger trend of using large language models for conversational applications. These models have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology, allowing us to interact with devices and services in a more natural and intuitive way. However, it is important to note that these models are not perfect, and may sometimes generate text that is irrelevant, offensive, or factually incorrect. In conclusion, ChatGPT is a powerful conversational language model that is capable of generating human-like text in response to an input prompt. It has a wide range of potential applications, from chatbots and virtual assistants to NLP tasks such as question answering and text classification. However, it is important to carefully consider the limitations and potential risks associated with these models, and to use them responsibly.},

	abstract = {This research aims to examine the factors influencing the adoption of ChatGPT in educational institutions in Botswana. It addresses three major gaps. The first is the lack of research on AI adoption for teaching and learning in developing countries, particularly Botswana. While AI adoption in education has been studied globally, there is little understanding of how tools such as ChatGPT and Jenni AI are perceived in this context. Second, there is a lack of research on the infrastructure and digital disparities that developing countries face when integrating AI in education, especially in rural areas. Third, the use of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) 2 in studying AI adoption in educational settings in low-resource countries remains underexplored. This study employed a quantitative design, collecting data from 518 participants through online questionnaires using a snowball sampling technique. The data were analysed using confirmatory factor analysis in SmartPLS 3.0 software in order to ensure internal consistency and validity. The findings revealed that personal innovativeness and performance expectancy were the strongest predictors of ChatGPT adoption, while social influence and resource availability had less impact. The model explained over 50\% of the variance in behavioural intention and usage behaviour. The research highlights the need for training and infrastructure improvements to support AI adoption in Botswana's higher education. It also calls for future research using mixed methods to gain deeper insights. This study is among the first to apply UTAUT2 in this context and provides valuable findings for both scholars and practitioners looking to advance AI adoption in developing countries.},

	abstract = {This article investigates the critical role of Digital Literacy (DL) in shaping the adoption and use of ChatGPT. As advanced AI tools rapidly integrate into daily life, it is essential for both policymakers and technology developers to understand the factors driving their mainstream adoption. DL was quantified using the Internet Skills Scale (ISS) tool, applied on a scale of 0 to 10 across six areas of ChatGPT application: general use, testing possibilities, entertainment, fulfilling work and school tasks, obtaining new knowledge, and companionship during moments of solitude. The study employs non-parametric difference tests, relational analyses, and binomial logistic regression models, analysing data from a statistically representative sample (N = 1,025) of the Czech population. The findings reveal significant relationships between DL and five of the six areas. Higher DL levels correlate with using ChatGPT for testing, entertainment, and acquiring new knowledge. Conversely, lower DL levels are linked to using ChatGPT as a companion during moments of solitude. Notably, no significant relationship was found between DL and using ChatGPT for work or educational purposes. These results suggest that as DL improves, the use of AI tools like ChatGPT will diversify across different contexts. The study highlights the need for targeted DL programs to enhance AI adoption, reduce digital inequalities, and ensure that advanced technologies are accessible to all population segments.},

Consequently, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of factors within the extended value-based adoption model (VAM) and to delineate the individual contributions of these factors toward shaping the attitudes of university students regarding the utilization of ChatGPT for instructional purposes. This investigation incorporates dimensions such as social influence, self-efficacy, and personal innovativeness to augment the VAM. This augmentation aims to identify components where a hybrid approach, integrating partial least squares (PLS), artificial neural networks (ANN), deep neural networks (DNN), and classification algorithms, is employed to accurately discern both linear and nonlinear correlations. The data for this study were obtained through an online survey administered to university students, and a purposive sample technique was employed to select 369 valid responses. Following the initial data preparation, the assessment process comprised three successive stages: PLS, ANN, DNN and classification algorithms analysis. Intention is influenced by attitude, which is predicted by perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, social influence, self-efficacy, and personal innovativeness. Moreover, personal innovativeness has the maximum contribution to attitude followed by self-efficacy, enjoyment, usefulness, social influence, technicality, and cost. These findings will support the creation and prioritization of student-centered educational services. Additionally, this study can contribute to creating an efficient learning management system to enhance students' academic performance and professional efficiency.},

Additionally, the study assessed the impact of self-efficacy, a second-order construct, on perceived behavioral control. Finally, the study attempted to determine the moderating impact of firm size on the relationship between the factors in the TPB model in the OAS context. A semi-structured outline was employed to discuss qualitative research, and data were collected from 1118 businesses in five of Vietnam's most populous cities using a structured questionnaire. The Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling method validated the conceptual research model. The study's results suggest that the company's attitude toward online advertising services, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control of the organization all affected the willingness to continue utilizing OAS. Furthermore, the research found that self-efficacy positively influenced behavioral control, a reflective notion. Furthermore, the result investigated the impact of business size on the relationship between the intention and attitude toward continued consumption of OAS and perceived behavioral control. Hence, the OAS business should improve the implications related to the TPB model for firms’ continuous adoption intention and evaluate firm size as the critical factor, which moderates the relationship between attitude and perceived behavioral control and continuous intention.},

ChatGPT, an extensively recognized language model created by OpenAI, has gained significant importance, particularly in education. This study investigates the awareness, acceptance, and adoption of ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI, in higher education institutions across China. This study applies the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method for examining data collected from 320 Chinese university students. The study’s conceptual framework integrates key determinants from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and extends it by incorporating perceived intelligence as a critical factor in the adoption process. The study findings reveal that ChatGPT awareness significantly influences the intention to adopt ChatGPT. Perceived ease of use, usefulness, and intelligence significantly mediate the association between ChatGPT awareness and adoption intention of ChatGPT. Additionally, perceived trust significantly moderates the relationship between ChatGPT awareness and perceived ease of use, usefulness, and intelligence. Moving forward, in order to maintain students’ critical thinking skills and inventiveness in their assessment writing, assessments must promote the safe use of ChatGPT. Therefore, educators will be crucial in ensuring that artificial intelligence tools are used in assessments ethically and suitably by providing clear guidelines and instructions.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, in a connected and digital world IT tools are used widely in many areas of human activity. They are great supporters and accelerators of entertainment and business, but also play more and more significant role in education. Computer applications and platforms are successfully used at every stage of educational process in kindergarten, primary and secondary schools, colleges, also at the universities. They are also very helpful in education of adult, employed people and even the oldest members of the society. IT tools are also frequently used in lifelong learning programmes. In many cases IT solutions allow not only for acquiring new knowledge and skills but also for development of digital literacy and preventing both teachers and students from the digital exclusion. They are allowing also for integration of the learning community members of different age, with different physical abilities and coming from various regions or cultures. Computer science, the main driver of information technology development is one of the fastest changing field of science. Therefore, we can observe rapid development of newer and newer IT technologies and tools, that can be successfully implemented into educational process. IT solutions become more and more available (mostly as an internet services or mobile applications), free of charge (economic availability) and easy to use due to visual, intuitive user interfaces (availability of usage).

The aim of the article is to present how two IT platforms (Virtual Campus and Archive of Archive of Theses System) used by Faculty of Economics Maria Curie-Sklodowska University support the undergraduate and graduate thesis seminars. The paper contains the characteristic of the thesis seminar programme, presents the framework of e-learning course prepared for its attendants. The course consists of communication tools section, methodical section, work plan and provides all the materials and trainings necessary to prepare students for the final exam. The second part of the article contains the description and the analysis of the Archive of Theses System - workflow system that automates the process of work with final version of dissertation: reviewing, anti-plagiarism control and publishing the final work. At the end of the article the author presents the main benefits and problems related to supporting thesis seminar with analyzed IT platforms.

The author’s observations and participants’ opinions allow to conclude that business students want to and know how to use the e-learning platforms in educational process. The main benefits of their usage are: more systematized and effective work, greater flexibility, easier communication, avoiding many unnecessary or duplicated activities, easy monitoring and automatic archiving of the outcomes. Completed classes showed also some problems that have to be considered. At the beginning of the seminar students have to be strongly stimulated and moderated. Supervisor should explain precisely what tools should be used and in what way. For effective course realization the seminary classroom should be equipped with computers connected to the Internet that would enable the parallel work. Finally, using IT tools makes work easier but causes dependence on hardware, software and the internet connection. If one of these elements fails, it is quite difficult to conduct seminar classes effectively.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes an advanced method for recognizing learners' emotions by incorporating the use of emojis to reflect the modern communication tendencies of learners, typically young individuals. The method is built on the PhoBERT model, a variant of BERT optimized for Vietnamese. Data was collected from opinion surveys of learners at the Ho Chi Minh City campus of the University of Transport and Communications to train and test the model. The system is designed to analyze text and recognize seven basic emotions: enjoyment, trust, hope, sadness, surprise, fear, and others. Corresponding emojis are then assigned to each emotion type to more clearly illustrate the learners' emotional states. Experimental results show that combining PhoBERT and emojis not only enhances the accuracy of emotion recognition but also makes communication more intuitive and vivid. The model achieved an accuracy of 74.1\%. The paper also discusses practical applications of this system in the field of education, where teachers can quickly and accurately understand and respond to students' emotions, thereby improving teaching effectiveness.},

Results indicate that LR, while fast, struggled due to the dataset's lack of linearity, often predicting negative prices. RF, leveraging its tree-based structure, performed well in capturing both linear and non-linear patterns but incurred higher errors. FNN, despite requiring more training time, achieved superior performance in all metrics, highlighting its ability to discern intricate patterns in high-dimensional datasets. This research underscores the importance of model selection based on dataset characteristics and provides insights into optimizing machine learning applications in automotive resale markets.},
